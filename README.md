# Custom Servers
I recommend to play this mod only on custom servers (for example [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor), note that modded handshake is required to play the mod [Example Modded Handshake by js6pak](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor.Impostor)), if you own an Impostor server, make sure AntiCheat and BanIpFromGame are set to false in the config.json file. This mod has [Unify by Daemon](https://github.com/MoltenMods/Unify) implemented, which you can use to select the custom region to join a custom server by entering the IP or domain name and the port of the server.

-----------------------

# Settings
This mod adds a custom lobby which I won't spoil to you, it also adds four colors (Lavender, Petrol, Mint and Olive) and four settings to the client option tab:
- **Hide Room Code:** More like streamer mode, activating this option will hide the room code and replace it with "Las Monjas"
- **Game Summary:** Activating this option will create a list containing which role and task progress the players had after the game ends.
- **Activate Music:** Music pack containing 7 songs from Kevin MacLeod (1 for Lobby, 3 for Tasks and 3 for Meeting depending of how many players are alive)
- **Ghost Can See Roles:** Only after being reported, ghosts would be able to see which role the players have.
- **Horse Mode:** Activate 2022 1st April Fools, remember to take of your skin if you activate Horse Mode.

-----------------------

# Roles

Roles can be activated by putting them at 100% spawn rate (there's only 0% and 100%). Activated roles will be in the game by two possible ways, you can set the role assignment system in the lobby to be random or by list order. Setting to random will put the activated roles in a list which will be assigned randomly to the players. There's a total of four teams and there can be only be 1 Neutral and 1 Rebel per game.

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**

- If the time to use medkit reach 0 (this timer doesn't show anywhere to add tension), that Survivor will turn into a Zombie.
-Nurse is immune to the infection, she can pick a medkit (pointed by pink arrows) from 3 different map location and use it on a infected player (yellow name) to cure it. She can carry only 1 medkit at once and will lose it if she gets killed. A healed player has to be infected again to try to turn it into a zombie.
- Infirmary is the Nurse's spawn and only survivors can enter in it. After 10 seconds, survivors will be forced to exit it. The Nurse can enter and stay in it anytime she wants, also she can leave from 3 different location to prevent Zombie spawn camping. There's 2 switches in the Infirmary, the left one is for delivering a key item and the right one is to create the cure when all key items are delivered, making the Survivor team the winner.
- Survivors have to look for the key items hided in the boxes around the map and deliver them to the Infirmary.
- Zombies can kill, the Nurse can't and the Survivors can find ammo on random boxes, which makes them able to kill 1 time (after being killed or killing a Zombie they will have to search the same ammo box to recharge their kill button)
- Boxes loot are random for every player even the location is the same for everyone. There are 60 box on every map, 6 of them contains the key items, 4 contains ammo and the rest are empty. For example Survivor 1 can find ammo on Admin while Survivor 2 finds it on Reactor, the same goes with the key items. 
- If you're delivering a key item, you can't search boxes or kill and you'll lose it if you die or turn into a zombie, making the key item return to their original location.
- If a Zombie disconnects from the game and was the only one, survivors will win. Also if the Nurse disconnects, zombie team will win.
- There are custom messages for somebody gets infected, delivered a key item or someone turned into a zombie.
- Revive Time value is calculated by subtracting Invincibility Time value from it, for example if Revive Time is 8 and Invincibility Time is 3, players will revive after 5 seconds but will be invincible for another 3 seconds after reviving.
- Score message is always shown, telling how many key items had been delivered, how many survivors are alive, how many infected are and how many zombies are.

# CustomCosmetics

A custom hats system (adapted from [xxomega77](https://github.com/xxomega77xx/HatPack)) has been added, also thanks to that I could add a method to add custom visors and nameplates too. Hats don't replace visors and some have adaptative color. It can also have some color or position bugs, we'll try to fix them in the future while also adding new hats.

-----------------------

# Submerged

From Las Monjas 1.5.0 version, [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged) is included on the modpack and can be played either on roles game or any gamemodes. There's still a few changes exclusively when playing on Submerged:
- Custom arrows points towards the closest Elevator if the target is on the other floor.
- Central vents (the ones on the glass floor) can be used only by impostor roles. Any crewmate who can vent won't be able to use them.
- Mimic has a visual bug, if you're transformed into other player and get out of a vent, the hat (if it's adaptative) goes back to its original color, but its only a visual bug for the Mimic player, meaning other players still see the correct hat color.
- Challenger's arena has a visual bug, players won't see the others on the other floor.
- Mechanic can't fix O2 sabotage since it affects the players individually.
- Time traveler's rewind makes the players go back to the central area on both floors instead going back in time.
- Welder can't seal central vents or the one-way vent + its exit.
- Spiritualist revive point is fixed to Medbey on the upper floor and security on the lower one, instead the body's location.
- Vigilant can't put extra cameras, only check them remotely.
- All gamemodes use both floors, there's two revive points based on the player's floor and central vents can't be used.
